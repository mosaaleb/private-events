# 🎊 Private Events

## Intro
We built a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository 👉 `git clone git@github.com:suretrust/private-events.git`
2. Migrate 👉 `rails db:migrate`, Seed the database 👉 `rails db:seed` 
3. Start the server 👉 `rails s`
4. Go to localhost.
